    "poem": "September Tomatoes<br>BY KARINA BOROWICZ<br>The whiskey stink of rot has settled<br>in the garden, and a burst of fruit flies rises<br>when I touch the dying tomato plants.<br>Still, the claws of tiny yellow blossoms<br>flail in the air as I pull the vines up by the roots<br>and toss them in the compost.<br>It feels cruel. Something in me isnâ€™t ready<br>to let go of summer so easily. To destroy<br>what Iâ€™ve carefully cultivated all these months.<br>Those pale flowers might still have time to fruit.<br>My great-grandmother sang with the girls of her village<br>as they pulled the flax. Songs so old<br>and so tied to the season that the very sound<br>seemed to turn the weather.",
